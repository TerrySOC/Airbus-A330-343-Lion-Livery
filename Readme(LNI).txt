hello, and thanks for downloaading this livery...

did you know how to download it? no?
well, here are the steps:
download the files -> download -> select the files-> drag the files to Flightgear -> Data -> Aircraft -> A330 -> model -> liveries -> A333RR and that's it

this livery is not 1:1 replica, still missing some details, and the paintjob is "might be" not as good as you would expect.
the livery name is "Lion Air"

thanks
